Matrix Multiplication Project
Overview
This project implements matrix multiplication in C. It includes both a straightforward algorithm and an optimized version using more efficient techniques. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of matrix operations and performance optimizations in C.

Features
Basic matrix multiplication
Optimized matrix multiplication (e.g., using block multiplication)
Command-line interface for input
Detailed comments and explanations in code
Prerequisites
C compiler (e.g., GCC)
Basic understanding of matrix operations and C programming
Performance
The basic matrix multiplication algorithm has a time complexity 
The optimized version improves performance for larger matrices by using block multiplication.
